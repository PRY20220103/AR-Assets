3D scan of the mounted skin of a female European bison, or Wisent (Bison bonasus). The European bison is our continentâ€™s largest land mammal. Before their habitat was destroyed and they were nearly hunted to extinction, the European bison roamed large parts of Europe.

This specimen cannot be found in the exhibition halls of the museum, but a group of European bison is on display in Hall 36 of the NHM Vienna (Number 91 of the NHM Top 100).
